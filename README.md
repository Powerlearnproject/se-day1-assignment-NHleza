#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.-
Software engineering is the applivation of engineering princeples and techniques to the design, development,testing,and maintenance of software sstem.

Importance Are:
Quality and reliabilit
Cost and time saving
Securit and privacy
scalability and flexibility
innovation and competitiveness
risk management
collaboration and communication

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The NATO software engineering-Identify the software crisis ad its challanges 
Development of the waterfall model-Paved the way for subsequent software  development methodologies
Agile manifesto-Emphasized customer involvement, rapid delivery,and ccontinuos improvement 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-Define project scope,deliverables, also determine projec timeline, budget, and resources
Design-Develop a detailed design for the software,create architecture, components and interfaces
Development-Intergrate components into a working a working system,write code for software
Testinf-Verify ythat the software meets the requirements, conduct unit testing, intergration testing and system testing
Deployement- deliver the software to the production enviroment
Maintanence-continuosly monitor and evaluate the software's perfomance and qualit

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology- is a linear and sequential approach to software development, phases are completed one after other, with no overlap.
Waterfall is suitable for saftey-critical systems, regulated industries, and simle projects.

Agile methodology-is an iterative and increamental approah of software development,Development is broken down into small, iterative cycles, with continuos improvement
agile is suitable for complex projects,innovatetive projects, and project with uncertain requirements

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-Is responsible for designing, developing, and testing software applications.
Quality Assurance engineer-Is responsible for ensuring software quality through testing,defect management, and test automation.
Project Manager- Is responsible for overseeing project planning,execution, and delivery, ensuring that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE-is a software application that provide a comprehensive dvelopmet environment for writting,debgging, and testing softwre code.
Examples of IDE's-Java,C++, and phython.
VSC-sotware tool that helps developers manage changes to code, collaborate with otherss, and track changes over time.
Examples of VSC-Versioning, Merging, collaboration

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complexity
Meeting Tight Deadlines
Dealing with technical debt
Managing stress and burnout
Strategies to overcome these challanges:
Break down complex systems into smaller , independent modules that are easier to understand nd maintain.
Communicate regulary with stakeholders to manage expectations and negotiate deadlines when necessar
Seek support from collegues, and managers.
Take time off when needed, using vacation das or sick leave to recharge and burnout.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-Its involves testing individual units of code, such as functions, methods,or modules to ensure that they behave as expected.
Importance-Unit testing encourages developers to write better-structered, more moduler code,which is easier to maintainand extend.

Integration testing- involves how different units of code work together to ensure they integrate correctly.
Importance-Helps detect issues with interface between components or system.
Acceptance Testing- Involves testing software system to ensure it meet the required acceptance criteria,as defined b the stakeholders or customers.
Importance-Improves stakeholder confidence in the software system, as it demonstratest that the system, meet their requrements. 

System Testing-involves testing the entire software system, from user interface to backend, to ensure it meets the required functionality and perfomance
Importance-systemtesting improves systemreliability by ensuring that the entire system works correctly under various conditions.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering-is the process of designing and optimizing text prompt or inputs to elict specific, desired responses from Artificial Intelligence models such as language models,chatbods, or other machine learnig systems.
Importance- prompt engineering is crucial in interacting with AI models because it improves accuracy, enhance creativity, facilitate effective communcation. reduces bias and increase effeciency

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt-Create a plan for a new website
design a comprehensive plan for a new e-commerce website for a small business that sells outdoor gear and apparel.
The improved prompt- Is more effective because it provides a clear, specific and concise direction for the writer. By reducing ambiguity and providing a clear directions., the prompt ensure thst the writer producs high-quality response that meet the expected requirements
