# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.-
Software engineering is the applivation of engineering princeples and techniques to the design, development,testing,and maintenance of software sstem.
Importance Are:
Quality and reliabilit
Cost and time saving
Securit and privacy
scalability and flexibility
innovation and competitiveness
risk management
collaboration and communication

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-Define project scope,deliverables, also determine projec timeline, budget, and resources
Design-Develop a detailed design for the software,create architecture, components and interfaces
Development-Intergrate components into a working a working system,write code for software
Testinf-Verify ythat the software meets the requirements, conduct unit testing, intergration testing and system testing
Deployement- deliver the software to the production enviroment
Maintanence-continuosly monitor and evaluate the software's perfomance and qualit

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology- is a linear and sequential approach to software development, phases are completed one after other, with no overlap.
Waterfall is suitable for saftey-critical systems, regulated industries, and simle projects.

Agile methodology-is an iterative and increamental approah of software development,Development is broken down into small, iterative cycles, with continuos improvement
agile is suitable for complex projects,innovatetive projects, and project with uncertain requirements

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-Is responsible for designing, developing, and testing software applications.
Quality Assurance engineer-Is responsible for ensuring software quality through testing,defect management, and test automation.
Project Manager- Is responsible for overseeing project planning,execution, and delivery, ensuring that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
